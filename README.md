Basic Provolver support for After The Fall.

## Warning

Let me be very clear up front: ***After The Fall is a multiplayer game. If you try to cheat via mods, you are likely going to get your account banned, and
nobody will like you.*** Even with this workaround, After The Fall will know that you are running a mod, and it will tell you right at startup that it knows.
This mod here should be fine, it is not cheating and only provides additional immersive feedback, as anyone can see in this source code.

If you have any questions or comments, ping me (Astien) in the Protube Discord:

## Manual installation

Two ways to install :

### **1) Full install (You don't have the bhaptics mod already)**

Download [ProvolverFullInstall_AfterTheFall.zip](https://github.com/Astienth/AfterTheFall_Provolver/releases/download/1.0/ProvolverFullInstall_AfterTheFall.zip)

Extract in the game root folder so that it adds a bepinex folder and other files like this and launch with AfterTheFall_modding.exe

### **2) If you already installed the bhaptics mod**

Download the [ProvolverPluginOnly_AfterTheFall.zip](https://github.com/Astienth/AfterTheFall_Provolver/releases/download/1.0/ProvolverPluginOnly_AfterTheFall.zip) and extract in the game folder bepinex/plugins. You should have a folder named Provolver close to the bhaptics files.
