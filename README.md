# AfterTheFall_Provolver
Basic Provolver support for After The Fall.

## Warning

Let me be very clear up front: ***After The Fall is a multiplayer game. If you try to cheat via mods, you are likely going to get your account banned, and
nobody will like you.*** Even with this workaround, After The Fall will know that you are running a mod, and it will tell you right at startup that it knows.
This mod here should be fine, it is not cheating and only provides additional immersive feedback, as anyone can see in this source code.

If you have any questions or comments, ping me (Astien) in the bhaptics Discord:
